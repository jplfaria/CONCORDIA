fig|374463.4.peg.161,Sulfate-binding protein Sbp,"Sulfate/thiosulfate ABC transporter, sulfate-binding protein Spb",Broader,Narrower,"B adds contextual detail by indicating the protein is part of a sulfate/thiosulfate ABC transporter, increasing specificity (qualifier added specificity)"
fig|374463.4.peg.166,Glutaredoxin 3 (Grx3),Glutaredoxin 3,Exact,Exact,The inclusion of the gene symbol “(Grx3)” in A is a standard synonym and does not change functional meaning (qualifier clean‑up rule)
fig|374463.4.peg.288,Cys regulon transcriptional activator CysB,"Cys regulon transcriptional activator CysB, LysR family",Narrower,Narrower,"The addition of “LysR family” in B provides extra domain/family context, making it more specific (added specificity rule)"
