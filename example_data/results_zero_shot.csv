fig|273133.2.peg.157,Phage tail fiber,Phage tail fiber protein,Broader,"Phage tail fiber is a broader concept than phage tail fiber protein. The term ""phage tail fiber"" refers to the structural component of a bacteriophage, which is involved in recognizing and binding to host cells. It is composed of multiple proteins, including the phage tail fiber protein, which is one of the specific proteins that make up the tail fiber structure. Therefore, while the phage tail fiber protein is a part of the phage tail fiber, the latter encompasses the entire structure, including all its constituent proteins.**"

The term 'Phage tail length tape-measure protein T' specifies the protein with the letter 'T', which is often used in scientific literature to denote a specific protein within a category. The second entity, 'Phage tail, tail length tape-measure protein', describes the same protein without the specific designation 'T', but both terms refer to the protein responsible for measuring the tail length in bacteriophages. Therefore, they are synonyms, as they describe the same biological function and entity.**"
fig|273133.2.peg.156,Phage tail fiber,Phage tail fiber protein,Broader,"Phage tail fiber is a broader concept than phage tail fiber protein. The term ""phage tail fiber"" refers to the structural component of a bacteriophage, which is a complex assembly that includes various proteins and possibly other molecular components. In contrast, ""phage tail fiber protein"" specifically refers to the protein(s) that make up the tail fiber structure. Therefore, while the tail fiber protein is a crucial part of the tail fiber, the term ""phage tail fiber"" encompasses the entire structure, which may include multiple proteins and other elements.**"

fig|273133.2.peg.183,Phage endolysin,Phage endolysin N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (EC 3.5.1.28),Broader,"Phage endolysin is a broader concept than Phage endolysin N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (EC 3.5.1.28). Phage endolysins are enzymes produced by bacteriophages to degrade the bacterial cell wall, facilitating the release of new viral particles. They can have various enzymatic activities, including glycosidase, amidase, and endopeptidase activities. Phage endolysin N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase is a specific type of phage endolysin that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the amide bond between N-acetylmuramoyl residues and L-alanine in the peptidoglycan of bacterial cell walls. Therefore, while all N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases are phage endolysins, not all phage endolysins are N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases.**"
fig|273133.2.peg.185,HNH homing endonuclease,Phage homing endonuclease,Related,"HNH homing endonuclease and Phage homing endonuclease are related entities as both are types of homing endonucleases, which are enzymes that recognize specific DNA sequences and introduce double-strand breaks. The HNH homing endonuclease is characterized by the presence of the HNH motif, a conserved sequence that is involved in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Phage homing endonucleases, on the other hand, are a subset of homing endonucleases found in bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria. While phage homing endonucleases can include HNH endonucleases, they are not limited to this type and can encompass other motifs and structures. Therefore, while they share functional similarities and can overlap, they are not identical or synonymous, making them related but distinct entities.**"

fig|374463.4.peg.181,hypothetical protein,Outer membrane beta-barrel assembly protein BamD,Different,"The entity 'hypothetical protein' refers to a protein predicted to exist based on genomic data but for which no experimental evidence of function or structure is available. It is a general term used in genomics and proteomics to denote proteins that have been identified through computational methods but have not been characterized. On the other hand, 'Outer membrane beta-barrel assembly protein BamD' is a specific protein that is part of the BAM complex involved in the assembly of beta-barrel proteins in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. BamD has a defined role and structure within this complex. Therefore, these entities are completely different concepts, with 'hypothetical protein' being a broad, undefined category and 'BamD' being a specific, characterized protein with a known function.**"
