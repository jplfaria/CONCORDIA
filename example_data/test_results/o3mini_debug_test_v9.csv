fig|273133.2.peg.166,Phage DNA helicase,Phage DNA helicase (EC 3.6.4.12),Narrower,Annotation B adds specificity by including the EC number (EC 3.6.4.12) not present in Annotation A (see Rule 1 on qualifier clean-up and new specific function)
fig|273133.2.peg.76,Phage DNA helicase,Phage DNA helicase (EC 3.6.4.12),Narrower,Annotation B adds specificity by including the EC number (EC 3.6.4.12) not present in Annotation A (Rule 2)
