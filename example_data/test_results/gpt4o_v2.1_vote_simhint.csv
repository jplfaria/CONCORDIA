Carbon storage regulator,RNA-binding protein CsrA,Related,0.288,"Carbon storage regulator and RNA-binding protein CsrA are related as CsrA is a key component of the carbon storage regulatory system, influencing the storage and utilization of carbon in bacteria through its RNA-binding activity.",False,Related;Related
Polysaccharide biosynthesis protein,Oligosaccharide/polysaccharide export flippase Wzx,Related,0.452,"Both entities are involved in the process of polysaccharide biosynthesis and export, with one being a biosynthesis protein and the other a flippase involved in export, indicating a functional relationship in the polysaccharide synthesis and transport pathway.",False,Related;Related
FIG00614844: hypothetical protein,hypothetical protein,Uninformative,0.765,"The entities are both labeled as hypothetical proteins, but without additional context or information, it's not possible to determine a specific relationship between them.",False,Uninformative;Uninformative
Putative permease,hypothetical protein,Uninformative,0.451,"The terms 'putative permease' and 'hypothetical protein' are both vague and do not provide enough specific information to determine a clear relationship between them. 'Putative permease' suggests a protein thought to be involved in transport across membranes, while 'hypothetical protein' indicates a protein predicted based on gene sequences but not yet characterized. Without additional context or specific details, their relationship cannot be accurately classified.",False,Uninformative;Uninformative
phosphoribosyltransferase,hypothetical protein,Different,0.185,"Phosphoribosyltransferase is a specific enzyme involved in biochemical processes, whereas a hypothetical protein is a predicted protein whose function is not yet characterized. They represent distinct concepts in the biomedical field.",False,Different;Different
FIG00524300: hypothetical protein,hypothetical protein,Uninformative,0.758,"The entities are both labeled as ""hypothetical protein,"" but without additional context or information, it's not possible to determine the exact relationship between them.",False,Uninformative;Uninformative
FIG00617511: hypothetical protein,hypothetical protein,Uninformative,0.77,"The entities both refer to hypothetical proteins, but without additional context or information, it's not possible to determine if they are identical, synonyms, or related in a specific way.",False,Uninformative;Uninformative
ATPase,hypothetical protein,Different,0.211,"ATPase is an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of ATP into ADP and a free phosphate ion, while a hypothetical protein is a predicted protein whose function is not yet characterized or confirmed. These are completely different concepts.",False,Different;Different
FIG01145086: hypothetical protein,hypothetical protein,Exact,0.75,"Both entities refer to a hypothetical protein, indicating they are identical or functionally equivalent.",False,Exact;Exact
hypothetical protein,Phage protein,Related,0.458,"Hypothetical protein and phage protein are related as they both refer to proteins, but one is a general term for proteins predicted or inferred without known function, while the other is specific to proteins associated with bacteriophages.",False,Related;Related
FIG01125089: hypothetical protein,hypothetical protein,Uninformative,0.74,"The entities are both labeled as hypothetical proteins, but without additional context or information, it's not possible to determine their exact relationship or functional equivalence.",False,Uninformative;Uninformative
