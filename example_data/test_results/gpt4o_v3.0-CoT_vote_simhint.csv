FIG00614844: hypothetical protein,hypothetical protein,Uninformative,0.765,"The entities are both labeled as hypothetical proteins, but without additional context or information, it's not possible to determine the exact relationship between them.",False,Uninformative;Uninformative
Putative permease,hypothetical protein,Uninformative,0.451,"The terms 'putative permease' and 'hypothetical protein' are both vague and do not provide enough specific information to determine a clear relationship between them. 'Putative permease' suggests a protein thought to be involved in transport across membranes, while 'hypothetical protein' indicates a protein predicted based on gene sequences but not yet characterized. Without additional context or specific details, their relationship cannot be accurately classified.",False,Uninformative;Uninformative
