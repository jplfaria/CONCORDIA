Carbon storage regulator,RNA-binding protein CsrA,Related,0.288,"Carbon storage regulator and RNA-binding protein CsrA are related as CsrA is a key component of the carbon storage regulatory system, influencing the storage and utilization of carbon in bacteria through its RNA-binding activity.",False,Related;Related
Polysaccharide biosynthesis protein,Oligosaccharide/polysaccharide export flippase Wzx,Related,0.452,"Both entities are involved in the process of polysaccharide biosynthesis and export, with A focusing on biosynthesis and B on export, indicating a functional relationship in the polysaccharide production pathway.",False,Related;Related
FIG00614844: hypothetical protein,hypothetical protein,Uninformative,0.765,"The entities are both labeled as hypothetical proteins, but without additional context or information, it's not possible to determine the exact nature of their relationship.",False,Uninformative;Uninformative
Putative permease,hypothetical protein,Uninformative,0.451,"The terms 'putative permease' and 'hypothetical protein' are both vague and do not provide enough specific information to determine a clear relationship between them. 'Putative permease' suggests a protein thought to be involved in transport across membranes, while 'hypothetical protein' indicates a protein predicted based on gene sequences but not yet characterized. Without additional context or specific details, their relationship cannot be accurately classified.",False,Uninformative;Uninformative
phosphoribosyltransferase,hypothetical protein,Different,0.185,"Phosphoribosyltransferase is a specific enzyme involved in biochemical processes, while a hypothetical protein is a predicted protein whose function is not yet characterized. They represent distinct concepts in the biomedical field.",False,Different;Different
FIG00524300: hypothetical protein,hypothetical protein,Uninformative,0.758,"The entities are both described as ""hypothetical protein,"" but without additional context or specific identifiers, it's not possible to determine if they are identical, synonyms, or related in another way.",False,Uninformative;Uninformative
FIG00617511: hypothetical protein,hypothetical protein,Uninformative,0.77,"The information provided does not specify any distinct characteristics or functions of the hypothetical protein FIG00617511 compared to the general term ""hypothetical protein,"" making it impossible to determine a specific relationship.",False,Uninformative;Uninformative
ATPase,hypothetical protein,Different,0.211,"ATPase is an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of ATP into ADP and a free phosphate ion, while a hypothetical protein is a predicted protein whose function is not yet characterized or confirmed. These are completely different concepts.",False,Different;Different
FIG01145086: hypothetical protein,hypothetical protein,Exact,0.75,"Both entities refer to a hypothetical protein, indicating they are identical or functionally equivalent.",False,Exact;Exact
hypothetical protein,Phage protein,Related,0.458,"Hypothetical protein and phage protein are related as they both refer to proteins, but one is a general term for proteins predicted or not yet characterized, while the other is specific to proteins associated with phages.",False,Related;Related
