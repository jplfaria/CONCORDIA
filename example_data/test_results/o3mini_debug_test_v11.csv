fig|374463.4.peg.298,Manganese transport protein MntH,"Mn(II) and Fe(II) import protein MntH, proton-dependent",Narrower,Annotation B adds specificity by including Fe(II) transport and proton-dependent mechanism not present in A (Qualifier clean-up rule 1)
fig|374463.4.peg.181,hypothetical protein,Outer membrane beta-barrel assembly protein BamD,Uninformative,"Annotation A (""hypothetical protein"") provides no functional information to compare with the specific function in Annotation B (rule 1)"
