fig|273133.2.peg.157,Phage tail fiber,Phage tail fiber protein,Broader,0.944,"Phage tail fiber is a broader concept than phage tail fiber protein. The term ""phage tail fiber"" refers to the structural component of a bacteriophage, which is involved in recognizing and binding to host cells. It is composed of multiple proteins, including the phage tail fiber protein, which is one of the specific proteins that make up the tail fiber structure. Therefore, ""phage tail fiber"" encompasses the entire structure, while ""phage tail fiber protein"" refers to a specific protein within that structure.**"
fig|273133.2.peg.54,Phage tail length tape-measure protein T,"Phage tail, tail length tape-measure protein",Exact,0.952,"The entities 'Phage tail length tape-measure protein T' and 'Phage tail, tail length tape-measure protein' refer to the same concept. Both describe a specific protein involved in determining the length of the phage tail, which is a critical structural component of bacteriophages. The high cosine similarity of 0.952 suggests that these terms are functionally equivalent, likely referring to the same protein or its role in phage morphology. The slight variation in wording does not change the fundamental identity or function of the protein described.**"

fig|273133.2.peg.166,Phage DNA helicase,Phage DNA helicase (EC 3.6.4.12),Exact,0.716,"The entities 'Phage DNA helicase' and 'Phage DNA helicase (EC 3.6.4.12)' are functionally equivalent. The addition of the Enzyme Commission number (EC 3.6.4.12) specifies the exact classification of the enzyme within the EC system, which categorizes enzymes based on the reactions they catalyze. In this case, both entities refer to the same enzyme, a helicase involved in unwinding DNA during phage replication. The EC number provides a precise identification but does not change the fundamental nature of the enzyme described. Therefore, they are considered exact in terms of their biological function and identity.**"
fig|273133.2.peg.76,Phage DNA helicase,Phage DNA helicase (EC 3.6.4.12),Exact,0.716,"The entities 'Phage DNA helicase' and 'Phage DNA helicase (EC 3.6.4.12)' are functionally equivalent. The EC number 3.6.4.12 specifically refers to a class of enzymes known as helicases, which are responsible for unwinding DNA strands, a function that is characteristic of phage DNA helicases.

fig|273133.2.peg.183,Phage endolysin,Phage endolysin N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (EC 3.5.1.28),Broader,0.576,"Phage endolysin is a broader concept than phage endolysin N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (EC 3.5.1.28). Phage endolysins are enzymes produced by bacteriophages to degrade the bacterial cell wall, facilitating the release of new viral particles. They can have various enzymatic activities, including amidase, lysozyme, and others. Phage endolysin N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase is a specific type of endolysin with a defined enzymatic activity (EC 3.5.1.28), which cleaves the bond between N-acetylmuramoyl and L-alanine in the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls. Therefore, while all N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases are phage endolysins, not all phage endolysins are N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases, making the former a narrower category within the broader concept of phage endolysins.**"
fig|273133.2.peg.185,HNH homing endonuclease,Phage homing endonuclease,Related,0.783,"HNH homing endonuclease and Phage homing endonuclease are related entities. HNH homing endonucleases are a specific type of homing endonuclease characterized by the presence of the HNH motif, which is a conserved sequence involved in DNA cleavage. Phage homing endonucleases, on the other hand, are homing endonucleases found in bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria. While HNH endonucleases can be found in various organisms, including phages, the term ""Phage homing endonuclease"" refers specifically to those endonucleases within phages. Therefore, they share a functional relationship as both are involved in DNA cleavage and mobility, but they are not identical or synonymous, nor is one a broader or narrower concept than the other.**"
fig|273133.2.peg.188,"Phage lysin, N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase",Phage endolysin N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (EC 3.5.1.28),Exact,0.867,"Both entities refer to the same enzyme, N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, which is a type of phage lysin or endolysin. The inclusion of the EC number (3.5.1.28) in entity B further specifies the enzyme classification, but does not change the functional equivalence between the two descriptions. Both terms describe the enzyme responsible for breaking down bacterial cell walls during phage infection, indicating they are identical or functionally equivalent.**"
fig|273133.2.peg.1,Phage repressor,Phage repressor protein,Broader,0.926,"The term ""Phage repressor"" refers to a general category of proteins that inhibit phage activity, typically by binding to DNA and preventing transcription of phage genes. ""Phage repressor protein,"" on the other hand, specifies the physical protein that performs this function. Therefore, ""Phage repressor"" is a broader concept encompassing various proteins that act as repressors, while ""Phage repressor protein"" refers specifically to the protein itself within this category. The high cosine similarity suggests a close relationship, but the distinction between a general function and a specific protein supports the broader classification.**"
fig|273133.2.peg.193,Phage tail length tape-measure protein T,"Phage tail, tail length tape-measure protein",Exact,0.952,"The entities 'Phage tail length tape-measure protein T' and 'Phage tail, tail length tape-measure protein' refer to the same concept. Both describe a protein involved in determining the length of the phage tail, which is a critical component of the phage structure.

The high cosine similarity score of 0.952 further supports the conclusion that these entities are identical or functionally equivalent.**"
fig|374463.4.peg.296,Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49),Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (NADP+) (EC 1.1.1.49),Exact,0.967,"The entities A: Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) and B: Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (NADP+) (EC 1.1.1.49) refer to the same enzyme, which is responsible for catalyzing the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone using NADP+ as a cofactor. The EC number 1.1.1.49 is a unique identifier for this enzyme, indicating that both descriptions refer to the same biochemical activity. The mention of NADP+ in entity B is a specification of the cofactor used in the reaction, which is inherent to the enzyme's function described by the EC number. Therefore, these entities are functionally equivalent and represent the same enzyme.**"

The description of entity B as ""Mn(II) and Fe(II) import protein MntH, proton-dependent"" provides additional detail about the function and mechanism of the protein, but does not change the identity of the protein itself. Both entities describe the same protein with the same function, indicating they are functionally equivalent.**"
fig|374463.4.peg.181,hypothetical protein,Outer membrane beta-barrel assembly protein BamD,Different,0.394,"The entity 'hypothetical protein' refers to a protein predicted to exist based on genomic data but for which there is no experimental evidence or known function. On the other hand, 'Outer membrane beta-barrel assembly protein BamD' is a specific, well-characterized protein involved in the assembly of beta-barrel proteins in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. BamD is a component of the BAM complex, which is essential for the proper folding and insertion of outer membrane proteins. The cosine similarity score of 0.394 suggests some textual similarity, possibly due to shared general protein-related terminology, but functionally and contextually, these entities are distinct. Therefore, they are completely different concepts.**"
fig|374463.4.peg.282,Enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase [NADH] (EC 1.3.1.9),Enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (NADH) (EC 1.3.1.9),Exact,0.999,"The entities A and B refer to the same enzyme, as indicated by their identical Enzyme Commission (EC) number 1.3.1.9, which specifies the enzyme's catalytic activity. Both names describe the enzyme enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase that uses NADH as a cofactor. The slight variation in the naming convention does not imply any functional or structural difference, thus they are functionally equivalent.**"
fig|374463.4.peg.161,Sulfate-binding protein Sbp,"Sulfate/thiosulfate ABC transporter, sulfate-binding protein Spb",Synonym,0.76,"The entities ""Sulfate-binding protein Sbp"" and ""Sulfate/thiosulfate ABC transporter, sulfate-binding protein Spb"" refer to proteins involved in the transport of sulfate ions. The key similarity is that both are described as sulfate-binding proteins, which suggests they perform a similar function in binding sulfate ions as part of an ABC transporter system. The slight variation in naming could be due to different naming conventions or contexts, but the core function and role in sulfate transport indicate they are synonymous.**"
fig|374463.4.peg.166,Glutaredoxin 3 (Grx3),Glutaredoxin 3,Exact,0.864,"The entities ""Glutaredoxin 3 (Grx3)"" and ""Glutaredoxin 3"" are identical, as they refer to the same protein.

fig|374463.4.peg.288,Cys regulon transcriptional activator CysB,"Cys regulon transcriptional activator CysB, LysR family",Exact,0.901,"The entities 'Cys regulon transcriptional activator CysB' and 'Cys regulon transcriptional activator CysB, LysR family' refer to the same protein, CysB, which is a transcriptional activator involved in the regulation of the cysteine regulon. The additional information 'LysR family' in entity B specifies the family to which CysB belongs, but does not change the identity or function of the protein. Therefore, these entities are functionally equivalent, with entity B providing more specific classification within the LysR family of transcriptional regulators.**"
fig|374463.4.peg.289,DNA topoisomerase I (EC 5.99.1.2),DNA topoisomerase I (EC 5.6.2.1),Different,0.965,"DNA topoisomerase I (EC 5.99.1.2) and DNA topoisomerase I (EC 5.6.2.1) are classified under different Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers, indicating distinct enzymatic activities. EC 5.99.1.2 refers to an older classification for DNA topoisomerase I, which is involved in altering the topological states of DNA by making single-strand breaks. However, EC 5.6.2.1 represents a newer classification that specifically categorizes DNA topoisomerase I under the subclass of enzymes that act on DNA topological changes. The change in EC number reflects a reclassification based on updated understanding of enzyme function, suggesting that while they may perform similar roles, they are recognized as distinct entities in the context of enzyme classification.**"
fig|374463.4.peg.291,YciL protein,YciI protein,Related,0.835,"The YciL protein and YciI protein are likely related based on their naming convention, which suggests they may be part of the same operon or functional pathway in bacterial systems. Proteins with similar names often share functional or regulatory relationships, such as being involved in the same metabolic process or cellular response. However, without specific evidence of their functional roles or interactions, it cannot be determined that they are identical, synonyms, or have a broader/narrower relationship. The cosine similarity score of 0.835 indicates a high degree of relatedness, but not equivalence or synonymy.**"
