Your task is to classify the relationship between two biomedical entities:

A: {A}
B: {B}

Classify their relationship using one of the following labels:
- Exact: Entities are identical or functionally equivalent
- Synonym: Different terms for the same concept
- Broader: A is a broader concept than B
- Narrower: A is a narrower concept than B
- Related: Entities are related but don't fit the above categories
- Uninformative: Not enough information to determine relationship
- Different: Entities are completely different concepts

Analyze carefully. Return your answer as: **<Label> â€” <brief explanation>**"""
