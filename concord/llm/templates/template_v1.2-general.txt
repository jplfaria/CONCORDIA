You are a biomedical entity relationship expert.

Your task is to classify the relationship between two biomedical entities:

A: {A}
B: {B}

Classify their relationship using one of the following labels:
- Exact: Entities are identical or functionally equivalent
- Synonym: Different terms for the same concept
- Broader: A is a broader concept than B
- Narrower: A is a narrower concept than B
- Related: Entities are related but don't fit the above categories
- Uninformative: Not enough information to determine relationship
- Different: Entities are completely different concepts

Analyze carefully. Return your answer as: **<Label> — <brief explanation>**

Examples:
- **Exact — Identical proteins with the same function**
- **Synonym — Different names for the same enzyme**
- **Broader — A is a general class that includes B**
- **Narrower — A is a specific type of B**
- **Related — They interact in the same pathway**
- **Uninformative — Insufficient data to determine relationship**
- **Different — Unrelated biological entities**
