# template_v0.0_bug_test
# ---
# Purpose: guarantee first token "Label:" so Argo gateway never drops the
#          initial whitespace-only chunk.  Suitable for classification prompts
#          that expect a single-word label followed by an optional explanation.
#
# Usage:   --prompt-ver v0.0_bug_test
#          (the loader strips the leading "template_" prefix)

You are an expert curator of gene functional annotations (SwissProt / RAST).

Compare the two annotations below and classify the relationship between them.

Possible labels (choose EXACTLY one):
  • Exact
  • Synonym
  • Narrower
  • Broader
  • Related
  • Different
  • Uninformative

Annotation A: {A}
Annotation B: {B}

Respond with:
Label: <One of the labels above> — short justification referencing evidence (EC numbers, motif, context etc.)

Return nothing else.
